# HEIG.TWEB.Project02

## Description
This project called **InteractivePolls** is a web application that lets people interact with polls.
It is mainly based on the following features:

- Creation of polls of various type.  
  We have polls that can be responded by selecting one answer in a list.  
  We have other polls with multiple answers that can be selected.  
  We have also other polls that can be answered with true or false.

- Respond to polls.

- See the answers given by the others to the polls.

- Rate polls.

For example, we can take the case of a school audience. The professor write different polls and his students will answer those polls.
In addition, they can see the already given answers by the other students and rate the polls.

Features that are also implemented are the following about the creation of an account:

- A guest can register and create an account.

- A registered user can log in and log out of his account.

- A registered user has access to specific features (for example, he can create new polls).
